              <p class="fs_18 fw-500">Like most website operators, IBD Construction collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. IBD Construction's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how IBD Construction's visitors use its website. From time to time, IBD Construction may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
              <p class="fs_18 fw-500">IBD Construction also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://www.ibdinteriors.com blog posts. IBD Construction only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

              <p class="fs_18 fw-500">Certain visitors to IBD Construction's websites choose to interact with IBD Construction in ways that require IBD Construction to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that IBD Construction gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at http://www.ibdinteriors.com to provide a username and email address.</p>
